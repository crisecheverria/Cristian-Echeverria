## My personal journey with ReactJs

So as you probably know, I'm working as a Remote Web Developer for a really awesome company (Acklen Avenue), and with this job I was
introduced to remotely web development, and I have learned a lot, git, pull request, branches, commits and so on. Also, I started working with ReactJs for the first time, at first time when I started to learn about ReactJs it was the most popular frontend framework (that was my main reason) and I took a few tutorials about it but it was always bad times for me in order to understand ReactJs.

So I decided to go through an AWESOME course at Frontend Masters "Complete Intro to React" by Brian Holtz (really awesome course)and I was so excited about how React works and got dive into Webpack, Babel, Prettier, Flow, React Class Components, React Functional Components, State, Props, Testing and so on. It was a huge dive in to React ecosystem.

Also, it helped me a lot because I decided to teach about React in one of the most important private university in my country San Pedro Sula (unitec.edu), and I followed the Course from Brian Holtz step by step, but later I realize that my students wasn't following the course, so I decided to look at TylerMcginnis.com and paid a monthly subscription and I definitely recommend
it, the content is great, my only concern is that doesn't have subjects like testing React Components (at least I haven't see it yet), and testing is One of the Core Values at acklenavenue.com (the company where I work), so on that subject the "Complete Intro to React" from Brian Holtz was my first introduction to testing and it's great as a first contact.

I have to recognize that I'm still new about testing in React but also want to say that I receive great feedback and help from my coworkers mostly from one of our Senior Devs and Architect, we spend a few minutes the other day reviewing my code and it was GOLD for me, He told me about the purpose of testing and TDD (One of our core values at Acklen Avenue) and for the first time. I started to make baby steps with the TDD approach, now I know that we write better, clean, and easy to maintain/test code if we use TDD (write the test first, or as I like it to view it, write code thinking on how to test it in order to write easy to follow code).

So now, when I'm writing my code with React, I first think about the test that I need to write for those lines of code, and that help me a lot to refactor and try to clean my code as much as I can.

Another subject that has a great impact and trouble to my peace of mind is Redux, don't get me wrong, I know the advantages of using Redux in order to have our state (data) on one accessible function called the Store, but the think with Redux and React is all the verbose and scaffold that we need to setup just to start using Redux in our app, that hunted me for the first weeks
where I started to learn about Redux (and still learning). For that case, the TylerMcginnis.com site is helping me A LOT to get a better understanding about Redux and how it works, a better understanding on why Redux use Pure Functions,Strings Constants and more in order to keep track of our data, I'm also started to teach about Redux to my students at Unitec.edu, and that also
is helping me A LOT in order to REALLY try to understand how Redux works and then later combine it with React.

But, there are still a lot of subjects that I need to dive into like React Sagas, FlowType (more deeply) and of course testing with TDD.
